# crash-course

This is a tpp presentation that wants to be both a shell programming course and something funny.
It certainly does a bad job in regard to both.
However, if you are so crazy to be willing to clone this, you can see a terrible example of what
you can do with tpp, which is a basic and kind of pathethic way to create a presentation.
Just install tpp with aptitude, and run tpp $1.

You have been warned.
